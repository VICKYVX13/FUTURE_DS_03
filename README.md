# College Event Feedback Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes feedback data collected from college events such as **tech fests, workshops, and cultural activities**.  
The goal is to derive **student satisfaction insights** using rating data and text-based feedback.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess feedback data from Google Forms (CSV/Excel).
- Perform **sentiment analysis** on textual feedback using NLP (TextBlob/VADER).
- Analyze **rating distributions** for different events.
- Create **visualizations** for better understanding of satisfaction levels.
- Provide **actionable insights** to improve future events.

## 📂 Project Files
- `feedback.pbix` → Power BI Dashboard for interactive analysis.  
- `Student_Satisfaction_Survey.xlsx` → Raw survey data collected from students.  
- `CollegeEventFeedback.ipynb` → Jupyter Notebook for data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.  

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies
- **Python** (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, TextBlob, VADER)  
- **Power BI** (for interactive dashboards)  
- **Excel/Google Sheets** (data source from Google Forms)  

## 📊 Key Analysis
- **Rating Analysis** → Distribution of ratings across events.  
- **Sentiment Analysis** → Categorization of feedback as Positive, Neutral, or Negative.  
- **Word Clouds** → Highlighting most common feedback themes.  
- **Event Comparisons** → Satisfaction levels across workshops, tech fests, and cultural events.  

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Open the Jupyter Notebook `CollegeEventFeedback.ipynb` and run all cells to reproduce the analysis.  
2. Open the Power BI file `feedback.pbix` to interact with the dashboard.  
3. Refer to `Student_Satisfaction_Survey.xlsx` for the raw data.  

## 📌 Insights & Recommendations
- Students are generally **satisfied with workshops**, but **tech fests need improvement in organization**.  
- **Cultural events received high engagement**, but feedback suggests better time management.  
- **Negative sentiments highlight issues with venue capacity and scheduling**.
